# El Monte Notifier
### Helping our community with one mobile device at a time

### Special Note: This app won't store any private, personal information. The purpose is to bridge the disconnect between local government events and the residents.

<br /> 
<br />


## Description
A mobile app that will notify residents of El Monte of upcomming <i><b>official</b></i> events.

Some types of notifications are:
<ul>
  <li> COVID-19 Test Sites </li>
  <li> Vaccination Sites </li>
  <li> Town Hall Meetings </li>
  <li> (other generic important events) </li>
</ul>
It will notify the users via Push Notifications. This app will also provide a routing feature.


<br />
<br />

## Accessibility Options:
The app will be available in these popular languages in the community:
- English
- Spanish
- Mandarin
- Vietnamese

<br />
<br />

## Why Do We Need This App?
El Monte provides notifications for their public events; however, they are only pushed out through E-mail and via Instagram posts. To reduce the gap between the residents without social media, or residents without an email, this app will push notifications to their phone. They will be able to opt out of notifications for certain events as well as view upcoming or current events.

<br />
<br />

## Plan

### Front End
We are going to use Flutter due to its accessibility to programming Android and iOS apps efficiently.

### Back End
Hopefully, I can utilize Web Scraping and RSS Feeds to push notifications. The idea is to scrape raw information and detect what kind of event was just posted. Then, with the raw info, we can share this on the Body portion of the event in the app. There is a blueprint provided below to show that the app will look like.

## Blueprint
I did the blueprint over MS-paint, and made the canvas enormous. You may want to view the raw image to see all the details!
