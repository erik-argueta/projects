<h4>Cutting workload, boosting productivity and efficiency.</h4>

<h2>Description</h2>
I was tasked with retrieving iPads from schools and verifying them with a master list to make sure they:
<br></br>
<ol> 1. Had the correct iPads at the site </ol>
<ol>2. Update/Clear the iPads</ol>
<ol>3. Modify the school's batch by either adding or removing from the batch.</ol>
