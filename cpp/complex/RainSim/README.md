# RainSim 
### <i> What do you mean the chances of rain doesn't mean whether or not it will rain?? </i>

### Description
Did you know: The percentage of rain predicted means it will rain in that percent of the area.
* It may not make sense, but this program aims to help visualize such fact.
* Here, the user enters the dimensions of the area and the percent of rain. 
* Using a random number generator, the program will place an asteriks (*) on a cell that will experience rain.
<br />

### Special Notes
* Using the Exception class, I was able to fairly secure only appropriate inputs.
* I heard the main() should be clean and concise -- I aimed to achieve this.
* This project uses OOP (Object Oriented Programming) and pointers.
* This program was built and compiled on Xcode.

### How the Randomness is handled
To ensure the closest thing to a random result every time the user initiates the program, I used a seed random number generator with the current time of the user's pc as the seed.
