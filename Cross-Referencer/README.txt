======ABOUT======
Welcome to Cross-Referencer! This projects is meant to help drive project-based learning. I have
coded it in C++ and would love to have others collaborate with another language!


=====SCENARIO=====
You are assigned to locate devices with specific Serial Numbers. Here, you have a Master List of
the items' Serial Numbers, and you have several lists of Serial Numbers of items that have been distributed.

Your task is to find how many items have NOT been distributed, and which ones.
NOTE that there are gaps of empty space in the Master.txt, and that is on purpose. You must consider
those as an item that is missing, even in the Master List.




======SPECIFICS======

First and foremost, you are comparing the schools' list to the master list! This means everything
will output to the order of the master list. This is to keep consistency.

There is a directory labeled "Schools". This contains lists of items that have been distributed to
specific schools.

missing-items.txt is where a list of missing items' Serial Numbers will be printed.



OPTIONAL:
    Debug.txt is a file containing all the work done by the program. This is more for the programmer
    to make sure the program is working as intended.

    It may enhance the program if the output.txt also displays the distributed Serial Number and the
    school that it was distributed to

    You may be creative and add additional files for whatever purpose that enhances the program.



=====NOTES=====
...



======LANGUAGE======
* For now, the program will be coded in C++

======EXAMPLE======
I believe all txt files are already written. You may refer to them and imitate them with your own txt
files.
